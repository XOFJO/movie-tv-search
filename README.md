# Movie & TV Search project

## In this project, user can find their desired movies or TV shows.

This project was built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It retrieves movie data from The Movie Database API, including recently popular movies, shows, and more detailed information about each title. Users can search for any movie or show they desire. Additionally, I incorporated the Swiper API to enhance the presentation of recent popular movies.
